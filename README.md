## Python for Everybody (PY4E) Coursework

This repository contains my solutions and projects developed during the [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) (PY4E) course by Dr. Charles Severance. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to programming using Python, covering topics such as data structures, web data retrieval, and databases.
